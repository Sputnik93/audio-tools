# audio-tools
Some audio tools written in bash

Current tools include:
* audio-splitter : split a single audio file (usually an album in one track) into several audio files (usually the different tracks from the album)
* audio-tagger : automatically add id3v2 tags to multiple audio files using a description file in plain text
